## What Makes This README Special

### 1. Process Isolation Explained
Clear explanation of why FastAPI and Celery don't share memory:

```markdown
❌ In-Memory Signal (Doesn't Work):
FastAPI: cancelled_scripts.add(123)  # In FastAPI memory
Celery: if 123 in cancelled_scripts  # Checks Celery memory
        └─> Never sees it! Different process!

✅ Database Signal (Works):
FastAPI: script.status = CANCELLED → PostgreSQL
Celery: db.refresh(script) → reads from PostgreSQL
        └─> Sees CANCELLED! Shared state!
```

### 2. Cooperative Cancellation Flow
Visual flow showing exactly how cancellation works:

```
User clicks "Stop"
    ↓
FastAPI updates database: status = CANCELLED
    ↓
Celery task checks database every loop iteration
    ↓
Task detects CANCELLED status
    ↓
Task kills subprocess
    ↓
Task saves final logs
    ↓
Task returns cleanly ✅
    ↓
Worker ready for next task! ✅
```

### 3. Complete Utility Scripts Documentation
Every helper script documented with:
- What it does
- How to run it
- What it checks/fixes
- When to use it

### 4. Real Examples
Actual Python code examples users can test with:
- Simple countdown script
- Infinite loop script (for testing cancellation)

### 5. Troubleshooting Commands
Not just "fix it" - actual commands to run:
```bash
python diagnose_scripts.py
python fix_script_paths.py
python test_google_oauth.py
```
